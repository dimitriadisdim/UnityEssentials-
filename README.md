# UnityEssentials
A vault for unity scripts that can be used in multiple projects

### Dialogue
Set up for the [yarn spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev/) tool, with a simple example

### Interfaces
Simple interfaces mostly used to trigger actions when the player raycast against an object  

### Managers
Game managers using the singleton pattern implemented with the MonoSingleton script

### FieldOfView
A script that draws a triangle (or a semi-circle if enough vertices are used), that renders only what is inside the field of view and a basic util class that contains some necessary mathematical conversions

### What else
-Three PlayerControllers (for 2d,3d and mobile) \
-An implementation of the object pool pattern \
-A script for implementing damage on a rigidbody2d (needs IDamagable interface)
